# Data-Encryption-with-AES-Algorithm
Here I have implemented the AES algorithm on Python - 3.

# Technology Used:
-Google Colab

-PyCrypto

-PyCryptodomex

# Features:
-An AES key will be taken as input and this key will be hashed by using SHA-256 algorithm

-The the message is taken as input.

-After that it will print the encrypted message and the decrypted original message.

-The time for the encryption and decryption will also be printed.

# Guidelines to Run this Project
-Go to colab.research.google.com

-Create a new notebook.

-Copy everything from my source file and paste in Google colab and run


-Or you can just open my souce file and click "Open in colab" and you can run it from there directly!
